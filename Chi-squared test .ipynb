    "##### History\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 19th century, statistical analytical methods were mainly applied in biological data analysis and it was customary for researchers to assume that observations followed a normal distribution, such as Sir George Airy and Professor Merriman, whose works were criticized by Karl Pearson in his 1900 paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of 19th century, Pearson noticed the existence of significant skewness within some biological observations. In order to model the observations regardless of being normal or skewed, Pearson, in a series of articles published from 1893 to 1916, devised the Pearson distribution, a family of continuous probability distributions, which includes the normal distribution and many skewed distributions, and proposed a method of statistical analysis consisting of using the Pearson distribution to model the observation and performing a test of goodness of fit to determine how well the model really fits to the observations.(Source: www.wikipedia.org))"

    "##### What is chi-squared test is used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-Square Test of Independence determines whether there is an association between categorical variables (i.e., whether the variables are independent or related). It is a nonparametric test. This test is also known as: Chi-Square Test of Association.\n",
    "The distribution of a categorical variable in a sample often needs to be compared with the distribution of a categorical variable in another sample. For example, over a period of 2 years a psychiatrist has classified by socioeconomic class the women aged 20-64 admitted to her unit suffering from self poisoning sample A. At the same time she has likewise classified the women of similar age admitted to a gastroenterological unit in the same hospital sample B.(source-https://www.bmj.com/)"
