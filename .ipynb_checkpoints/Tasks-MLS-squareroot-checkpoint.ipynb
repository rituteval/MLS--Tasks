    "A classic algorithm that illustrates many of these concerns is “Newton’s” method to compute squarerootsx=√afora >0, i.e. to solvex2=a. The algorithm starts with some guessx1>0andcomputes the sequence of improved guessesxn+1=12(xn+axn).The intuition is very simple: ifxnis too big (>√a), thena/xnwill be too small (<√a), andso their arithmetic meanxn+1will be closer to√a. It turns out that this algorithm is very old,dating at least to the ancient Babylonians circa 1000 BCE.1In modern times, this was seen to be equivalent to Newton’s method to find a root off(x) =x2−a. Recall that Newton’s methodfinds an approximate root off(x) = 0from a guessxnby approximatingf(x)as its tangent linef(xn) +f′(xn) (x−xn), leading to an improved guessxn+1from the root of the tangent:xn+1=xn−f(xn)f′(xn),and forf(x) =x2−athis yields the Babylonian formula above [1].\n",
